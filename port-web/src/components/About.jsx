          Hello! I'm Suryanarayan Kumar Yadav, a passionate front-end and back-end developer and data analyst. 
          With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I enjoy creating 
          efficient and scalable web applications. My experience includes working with various 
          programming languages and frameworks, enabling me to deliver high-quality solutions 
          tailored to client needs.

          In addition to my technical skills, I am a quick learner and a team player who thrives 
          in collaborative environments. I continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge 
          and apply innovative solutions to real-world problems. Outside of programming, I love 
          exploring new technologies, playing video games, and engaging in outdoor activities.
